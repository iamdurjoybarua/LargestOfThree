# Largest of Three Numbers (Java)

This Java program determines and prints the largest of three integer numbers entered by the user.

## Description

The program prompts the user to enter three integers. It then uses the `Math.max()` method (nested) to find the largest of the three numbers and prints the result to the console. The program also includes a `try-finally` block to ensure that the `Scanner` resource is closed properly, preventing resource leaks.

## How to Compile and Run

1.  **Save the code:** Save the Java code as `LargestOfThree.java`.

2.  **Compile:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file. Compile the code using the Java compiler:

    ```bash
    javac LargestOfThree.java
    ```

3.  **Run:** After successful compilation, run the program:

    ```bash
    java LargestOfThree
    ```

4.  **Input:** The program will prompt you to enter three integers, one at a time.  After each number, press Enter.

5.  **Output:** The program will then display the largest of the three entered numbers.
